		At Verney Conference Management, we believe that communication breeds efficiency. Our mandate is to provide the public sector with topical educational and networking opportunities in a relaxed and professional setting. Knowledge sharing with peers can save an organization many valuable resources. Through comprehensive research, we are able to dissect an issue, extracting the most appropriate topics while identifying the most appropriate speakers and topical experts capable of addressing the specific issues and challenges.<br><br>
        Our conference formats are designed to maximize the impact of our speakers, allowing participants to take full advantage of the knowledge exchanged. Providing the best forum and the best resources is paramount to our delegate experience. Our goal is for each delegate to not only walk away from a conference with a stronger understanding of the topic, but with the tools and expertise to implement solutions.<br><br>
